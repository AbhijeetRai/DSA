typedef struct node {
	
	int data; 
	struct node* ptr;
}node;


In node of linked list, when data is in do not carry condition (or there is no data) 
that node is called a dummy node. Dummy nodes are sometimes used as first nodes.  

Because, changing and returning first address after operations is not good idea. 
Hence actual first node is stored in dummy node. And dummy node keeps track of it. 

If address inside dummy node is empty, we know list is empty. 
But what if we have only explicit variable node* ptr = NULL. 
We would not even know whether ptr was previously pointing to single structure or whole list.
